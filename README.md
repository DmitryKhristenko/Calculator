# Calculator
A basic calculator for iOS, written in Swift.

The goals for this project were simple:

Create a basic calculator that supports the following functionality:

Supported math: +, -, *, /, %
Numbers can be positive or negative;
Decimal values also supported;
Supports landscape orientation.


I'm new to iOS development, so I'm eager to get feedback any aspect of this project.
